Implementing the vanilla Robust Matrix Factorization by Majorization Minimization (RMF-MM) for the papers: 
1. Zhouchen Lin, Chen Xu,and Hongbin Zha, Robust Matrix Factorization by Majorization-Minimization, 
   IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, accepted. 
2. Chen Xu, Zhouchen Lin, and Hongbin Zha, Relaxed Majorization-Minimization for Non-smooth and 
   Non-convex Optimization, pp. 812-818, AAAI 2016.

A unified variant to handle different constraints and regularizations will be updated soon.
